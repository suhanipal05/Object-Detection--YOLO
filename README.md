## 🧠 Object-Detection--YOLO
This repository demonstrates how to use YOLOv8 for real-time object detection on images, videos, and webcam streams. It also includes training on a sample dataset and a Streamlit app for easy deployment and showcasing of results.
<br><br>
## 📌 Features
* ✅Run object detection on uploaded images
* ✅Detect objects in videos and export annotated outputs

* ✅Capture and analyze frames directly from webcam in Colab

* ✅Fine-tune YOLOv8 on custom dataset (COCO128)

* ✅Interactive Streamlit web app with support for custom weights

* ✅Deploy Streamlit app to the web using Ngrok
